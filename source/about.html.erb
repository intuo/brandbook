        Learn more about the Intuo design patterns and guidelines.
      </p>

      <h3>What and why</h3>

      <p>
      The brandbook is Intuo's internal CSS framework.
      It includes basic global styling for typography,
      small components like buttons and tabs,
       and our general guidelines for writing HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        There’s a lot we can improve upon in the brandbook, and help is always
        appreciated. While we don’t currently plan on building this
        out as a competitor to other front-end frameworks,
        we will occasionally add, remove, or modify things.
      </p>

      <h3>Browser support</h3>

      <p>
        The brandbook currently supports Internet Explorer 9+ and
        the latest two versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on OS X and
        Windows. While not a responsive or mobile-focused project,
        Mobile Safari and Chrome for Android should render just fine.
        Support for Linux-based browsers is not strictly guaranteed,
        but accounted for whenever possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Future updates</h3>

      <p>
        See the <%= link_to "roadmap", "/roadmap.html",
          class: current_page.data.active == "roadmap" ? "active" : "" %> for a
        rough outline on what’s slated for future versions the brandbook.

	<h3>Facilitate coaching</h3>

	<hr>

	<p>
		We help individual or grouped coaches in our partner-network in their day to day activities. We can do this by giving them valuable information to enhance the quality of their service offerings. Secondly, we help them to scale their own business because we automate or enhance the time-consuming tasks that are not delivering immediate value to their cliënts.

        This means that we create a portal where coaches can manage their and our cliënts. We help them with sharing knowledge, growing their business and creating long-term relationships with their customers.
